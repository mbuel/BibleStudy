# Did the Apostle Paul teach Gentiles to worship God contrary to the law and the prophets?

As a NT only Christian how do you define these terms where the authors were referencing a deeper OT context?

## Without the OT and Particularly the law, what and how do you be holy?

{1Pe 1:12-17 HNV}  To them it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to you, did they minister these things, which now have been announced to you through those who preached the Good News to you by the Ruach HaKodesh sent out from heaven; which things angels desire to look into. Therefore, prepare your minds for action, be sober and set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Yeshua the Messiah -- as children of obedience, not conforming yourselves according to your former lusts as in your ignorance, but just as he who called you is holy, you yourselves also be holy in all of your behavior; because it is written, **"You shall be holy; for I am holy."** If you call on him as Father, who without respect of persons judges according to each man's work, pass the time of your living as strangers here in reverent fear:

{2Co 7:1 HNV} Having therefore these promises, beloved, *let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit,* **perfecting holiness in the fear of God.**

## What is unclean from a NT perspective without Torah?

{2Co 6:17 HNV} Therefore, "'Come out from among them, And be separate,' says the Lord, **'Touch no unclean thing.** I will receive you.

{Gal 5:19-21 HNV} Now the works of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, **uncleanness**, lustfulness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that **those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God.**

## What was God's goal in bringing in the Gentiles?

{Eph 2:11-16 HNV} Therefore remember that once you, the Goyim in the flesh, who are called "uncircumcision" by that which is called "circumcision," (in the flesh, made by hands); that you were at that time separate from Messiah, alienated from the commonwealth of Yisra'el, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now in Messiah Yeshua you who once were far off are made near in the blood of Messiah. For he is our shalom, who made both one, and broke down the middle wall of partition, having abolished in the flesh the hostility, the law of mitzvot contained in ordinances, that he might create in himself **one new man of the two**, making shalom; and might reconcile them both **in one body to God** through the cross, having killed the hostility thereby.

## If you are one body in Messiah, how should your behavior be reflected?

{Rom 11:11 HNV} I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall? May it never be! But by their fall salvation has come to the Goyim, to provoke them to jealousy.

## Does forsaking the eternal rest (Sabbath) and eating unclean animals make the Jews who keep the law jealous?

{Act 10:2-4 HNV} a devout man, and one who feared God with all his house, who gave gifts for the needy generously to the people, and always prayed to God. At about the ninth hour of the day, he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God coming to him, and saying to him, "Cornelius!" He, fastening his eyes on him, and being frightened, said, "What is it, Lord?" He said to him, "Your prayers and your gifts to the needy have gone up for a memorial before God.

{Act 10:34-35 HNV} Rock opened his mouth and said, "Truly I perceive that God doesn't show favoritism; but in every nation he who fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.

## Was the goal of Acts 15 to teach Gentiles they can forsake the law?

{Act 15:19-21 HNV} "Therefore my judgment is that **we don't trouble those from among the Goyim who turn to God**, but that we write to them that they *abstain from the pollution of idols, from sexual immorality, from what is strangled, and from blood*. For Moshe from generations of old has in every city those who preach him, **being read in the synagogues every Shabbat."**

## Did Paul teach Gentiles they can forsake the law?

{Rom 3:28 HNV} We maintain therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the **works of the law.**

{Rom 4:14 HNV} For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of no effect.

{Gal 2:21 HNV} I don't make void the grace of God. For if righteousness is through the law, then Messiah died for nothing!"

## Words of warning from Peter, whom Paul rebuked:

{2Pe 3:15-17 HNV} Regard the patience of our Lord as salvation; even as our beloved brother Sha'ul also, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you; as also in all of his letters, speaking in them of these things. In those are **some things hard to be understood, which the ignorant and unsettled twist, as they also do to the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.** You therefore, beloved, knowing these things beforehand, beware lest, being carried away with the error of the wicked, you fall from your own steadfastness.

## Words of warning from Paul, regarding the Lord:

{1Ti 6:1-5 HNV} Let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and the doctrine not be blasphemed. Those who have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brothers, but rather let them serve them, because those who partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. Teach and exhort these things. If anyone teaches a different doctrine, and doesn't consent to sound words, **the words of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah**, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness, he is conceited, knowing nothing, but obsessed with arguments, disputes, and word battles, from which come envy, strife, reviling, evil suspicions,  constant friction of people of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain. Withdraw yourself from such.

## What did Lord Yeshua the Messiah warn about the law?

{Mat 5:17-20 HNV} "**Don't think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I didn't come to destroy**, *but to fulfill.* For most assuredly, I tell you, until heaven and eretz pass away, not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are accomplished. **Whoever, therefore, shall break one of these least mitzvot, and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven;** but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven. For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the Sofrim and Perushim, there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.

## Did brother Paul teach Gentiles to worship God contrary to Torah?

{Act 18:13 HNV} saying, "This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law."

## Same statement from Paul ->

{Rom 1:28-32 HNV} Even as they refused to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting; 

being filled with all unrighteousness, (Deut 19:16)

sexual immorality, MORE than the 7th commandment! Sexual Immorality is defined in Leviticus, and Paul just taught from that! (Lev 18)

wickedness, (Ex 23:1)
covetousness, (10th commandment)
maliciousness; (Ex 23:1)
full of envy, (deut 7:25)
murder, (Ex 20:13 -> 6th commandment)
strife, (num 27:14, Deu 1:12)
deceit, (throughout OT, Job 15:35)
evil habits, (throughout torah)
secret slanderers, (Gossip - throughout torah, and prophets)
backbiters, (prov 25:23)
hateful to God, (num 10:35)
insolent, (Psalm 10:3)
haughty, 
boastful, 
inventors of evil things, 
disobedient to parents, (5th commandment) 
without understanding, 
covenant-breakers, 
without natural affection, 
unforgiving, 
unmerciful; 

who, knowing the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, *but also approve of those who practice them.*

{Rom 2:1-11 HNV} Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge. For in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things. We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things. Do you think this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God? Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance? But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God; who **"will pay back to everyone according to their works:"** to those who *by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and incorruptibility, eternal life*; but to those who are self-seeking, and don't obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath and indignation, oppression and anguish, on every soul of man who works evil, on the Yehudi first, and also on the Yevanit. But glory and honor and shalom to every man who works good, to the Yehudi first, and also to the Yevanit. For there is no partiality with God.

## What law is Paul teaching against in Rom 4:14, Rom 3:28 and Gal 2:21?

{Rom 3:1 HNV} Then what advantage does the Yehudi have? Or what is the profit of *circumcision?*

{Rom 3:1, 30-31 HNV} Then what advantage does the Yehudi have? Or what is the profit of *circumcision?* ... since indeed there is one *God who will justify the circumcised by faith, and the uncircumcised through faith.* **Do we then nullify the law through faith? May it never be! No, we establish the law.**

**THE LAW OF CIRCUMCISION**

{Rom 4:9-13 HNV} Is this *blessing then pronounced on the circumcised, or on the uncircumcised also?* For we say that faith was accounted to Avraham for righteousness. How then was it counted? **When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.** He received the **sign of circumcision, a seal** of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in **uncircumcision**, that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they be in **uncircumcision**, that righteousness might also be accounted to them. The father of **circumcision** to those who not only are of the **circumcision**, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Avraham, which he had in **uncircumcision**. For the promise to Avraham and to his seed that he should be heir of the world wasn't through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.

Paul's epistles are exegesis of Acts 15, and the Torah and the Prophets. He is not teaching Gentiles to worship God contrary to the Torah (law).

Look again at Paul's statement in verse 31 of chapter 3. It's so crucial to understanding this.

**Do we then nullify the law through faith? May it never be! No, we establish the law.**

Let's now look at Galatians - what is the central theme of the epistle?

{Gal 2:3 HNV} But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Yevanit, was compelled to be circumcised.

So what would have compelled the Galatians, the Jews by faith (Romans 2) to receive the sign of the covenant in their flesh?

{Gal 3:7 HNV} Know therefore that those who are of faith, the same are sons of Avraham.

They were learning Torah (Acts 15:21, 18:4), and saw passages like this:

{Gen 17:2-4, 10-12 HNV} I will make my covenant between me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly." Avram fell on his face. God talked with him, saying,  "As for me, behold, my covenant is with you. You will be the father of a multitude of nations. ... This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your seed after you. Every male among you shall be circumcised. You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin. It will be a token of a covenant between me and you. He who is eight days old will be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he who is born in the house, or bought with money of any foreigner who is not of your seed.

The command was to circumcise the foreigner - now the wisdom of James (NOT PAUL) revealed that the foreigners coming in didn't need to receive the mark in their flesh, as they showed the mark in their heart, **BY THEIR DEEDS**.

{Act 15:7-9 HNV} When there had been much discussion, Rock rose up and said to them, "Brothers, you know that a good while ago God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Goyim should hear the word of the Good News, and believe. God, who knows the heart, testified about them, giving them the Ruach HaKodesh, just like he did to us. He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.

This is Peter, explaining what happened with Cornelius - a **RIGHTEOUS GENTILE**

{Act 10:4 HNV} He, fastening his eyes on him, and being frightened, said, "What is it, Lord?" He said to him, **"Your prayers and your gifts to the needy have gone up for a memorial before God.**

Peter by the Holy Spirit recognized this in Cornelius:

{Act 10:34-35 HNV} Rock opened his mouth and said, "Truly I perceive that God doesn't show favoritism; but in every nation he who fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.

By their **DEEDS** they proved their heart to be circumcised.

{Deu 10:16 HNV} Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked.
{Deu 30:6 HNV} The LORD your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your seed, to love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.

This is why it's SO IMPORTANT to understand Torah, to read the ENTIRE Bible, not just the New Testament. God is returning for a chaste virgin, not a dirty filthy worldly gentile whore.

{1Th 4:3-5 HNV} For this is the will of God: your sanctification, that you abstain from sexual immorality, that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor, not in the passion of lust, even as the Goyim (Gentile) who don't know God;

{1Pe 4:1-3 HNV} Forasmuch then as Messiah suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind; for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin; that you no longer should live the rest of your time in the flesh for the lusts of men, but for the will of God. For we have spent enough of our past time living in doing the desire of the Goyim (GENTILE), and to have walked in lewdness, lusts, drunken binges, orgies, carousings, and abominable idolatries.

Being born a Gentile, you are not called to live a **SET APART** life, HOLY for God. Remember the question I started out with?

If you claim to be Christian, yet still live like the unsaved - are you a Jew by faith?

{Eph 5:3-7 HNV}  But sexual immorality, and all **uncleanness**, or covetousness, let it not even be mentioned among you, as becomes holy ones; nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not appropriate; but rather giving of thanks. Know this for sure, that no sexually immoral person, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Messiah and God. Let no one deceive you with empty words. For because of these things, the wrath of God comes on the sons of disobedience.  Therefore don't be partakers with them.

uncleanness, being "unclean" is more than just backsliding into sin. He lists other laws and sins here, even beyond the four given in Acts 15. The purpose of those four commandments, is to **FRAME** Torah, to lead pagans to become obedient servants of Yah.

When Brother Paul lists "UNCLEAN" or "UNCLEANNESS" He knew they would be doing as the Bereans do, as we see in Acts 15:21, Acts 18:4, Acts 26:20, Acts 28:23. They would search the "scriptures" (which did not include our New Testament) daily to see if those things were so.

Any doctrine we exegete (pull out) of the New Testament - MUST be pulled out of the OLD! There was NO NEW TESTAMENT, when Paul was teaching the Gospel in Acts to Gentiles. NONE. His epistles hadn't yet been written. 

If you're pulling ideas out of Paul's epistles that:

1) Make him a teacher against the law, specifically for Gentiles
2) Make him teaching a different Gospel than Yeshua (LORD, GOD)
3) Make him teaching a different Gospel than that you find IN ISAIAH THAT PAUL QUOTES

You are under a DELUSION, a DIFFERENT GOSPEL.

You are siding with the FALSE ACCUSERS who repeatedly tried to use that accusation to SHUT DOWN CHRISTIANS.

Against Stephen (Among the first Jewish converts)
{Act 6:13-14 HNV} and set up false witnesses who said, "This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the law.  For we have heard him say that this Yeshua of Natzeret will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moshe delivered to us."

Against Paul (twice)
{Act 18:13 HNV} saying, "This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law."

{Act 21:20-21 HNV} They, when they heard it, glorified God. They said to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Yehudim of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the law. They have been informed about you, that you teach all the Yehudim who are among the Goyim to forsake Moshe, telling them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs.

Now, **ACCORDING TO THE TORAH (LAW)** Were these false accusations true against either Paul or Stephen, both **DESERVED** death. But the false Gospel also is stretch to a fourth point, twisting the word fulfill (Matt 5:17) to mean abolish.

{Mat 5:17 HNV} "Don't think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I didn't come to destroy, but to fulfill.

However you interpret fulfill, IT CANNOT mean destroy or abolish. Do not think I came to destroy - so therefore fulfill cannot mean He's putting aside the law. And God, KNEW men would do so, thusly Yeshua goes on to complete the thought. He teaches that men should teach the law, and those who teach against the law, will be LEAST in the Kingdom.
