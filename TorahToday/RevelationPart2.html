    <h1 id="pageTitle">Revelation Part 2</h1>
    <div id="pageBody">
        <p>Now that we've covered the background of the various views, let's go over what the Lord has revealed to me. As I've said - our revelation of scripture should be continual. We should always be growing in knowledge and wisdom.</p>
        <p>First is the basic structure of the book. The opening of the book, describes the author (John) and the revelator (Yeshu'ah). It tells us what day we are seeing, and this will come as a shock to most who believe verse 10 is about Sunday. When we approach any verse, we <i>must</i> approach it with at least two or three witnesses, to make sound doctrine. I also now suggest for serious students, in addition to prayer, fasting? look at other translations. Don't limit yourself to reading one translation. There are <B>MANY</B> excellent translations out there, that may help you grasp this better, if you are also willing and able to listen to the Holy Spirit. The opening compromises the first three chapters, with letters to the seven major assemblies of that day. I don't really believe these represent "ages", I do believe John was addressing seven literal churches of that era. Like much of the Bible there are layers, and the seven assemblies have characteristics throughout the world's various assemblies.</p>
        <p>The first vision starts with John in Heaven at Chapter 4, as He opens with telling us - this is on the Day of the Lord. (NOT SUNDAY) It's important to remember - space and time are foreign concepts in Heaven. This is crucial to understanding John's visions, the book of Revelation is NOT MEANT TO BE LITERAL, nor is it meant to be read like you read John's Gospel. This goes through chapters 4 and 5, and glorifies Yeshu'ah as the glorious lamb.</p>
        <p>The second vision starts with Chapter 6, and end at 8:1. It's important to remember, chapter and verse divisions are <b>not</b> from God, but were added by men - and in fact CATHOLICS. Every believer should own at least one bible without chapter and verse divisions. The important things to look for in John's Revelation are these words, "Now I saw". When John uses these words, He's starting a <i>new</i> vision. This is clearly first seen in the events that unfold across the three events, the horns, the seals the bowls - all have a parallelism to them. Things that have to be happening around the same event or close to the same event.</p>
        <p>The third vision is actually interrupted at the sixth trumpet at the end of chapter nine for a fourth vision. It's clear, as John suddenly starts talking about another set of parallel events he was about to write down, the "seven thunders" that he was told to seal up and not record. Compare this to Daniel 12:4
            <p class='bibleQuote'>{Dan 12:4 HNV} But you, Daniyel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run back and forth, and knowledge shall be increased."</p>
            <p class='bibleQuote'>{Rev 10:4 NKJV} Now when the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, "Seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, and do not write them."</p>
            For whatever reason God had these visions sealed until the very last day. John tells us what Daniel saw will be revealed at the seventh trumpet. These are likely the seven thunders, that will also proclaim the <i>day of the Lord</i>. John then eats the book of knowledge, just as Ezekiel did.
            <p class='bibleQuote'>{Eze 2:8 NKJV} "But you, son of man, hear what I say to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you."</p>
            <p class='bibleQuote'>{Eze 3:1-3 NKJV} Moreover He said to me, "Son of man, eat what you find; eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel." So I opened my mouth, and He caused me to eat that scroll. And He said to me, "Son of man, feed your belly, and fill your stomach with this scroll that I give you." So I ate, and it was in my mouth like honey in sweetness.</p>
            <p class='bibleQuote'>{Rev 10:10-11 NKJV} Then I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth. But when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter. And he said to me, "You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, tongues, and kings."</p>
            There is an important and valuable lesson here in properly interpreting Revelation. You <i>must</i> read the Old Testament Prophets to <b>properly</b> understand and interpret John's revelation. He is not prophesying a new thing. Secondly, John tells us the same thing we see in those Prophets - showing us that what He's recording here <i>is not linear.</i>
            <p class='bibleQuote'>{Jer 25:30 NKJV} "Therefore prophesy against them all these words, and say to them: 'The LORD will roar from on high, And utter His voice from His holy habitation; He will roar mightily against His fold. He will give a shout, as those who tread [the grapes], Against all the inhabitants of the earth.</p>
        </p>
        <p>Starting in Chapter 11, John starts this prophecy - the fifth vision, of the two witnesses. There are <i>so many</i> theories on this, but it's clear if you go back to the Old Testament.
        <p class='bibleQuote'>{Zec 4:1-14 NKJV} Now the angel who talked with me came back and wakened me, as a man who is wakened out of his sleep. And he said to me, "What do you see?" So I said, "I am looking, and there [is] a lampstand of solid gold with a bowl on top of it, and on the [stand] seven lamps with seven pipes to the seven lamps. "Two olive trees [are] by it, one at the right of the bowl and the other at its left." So I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me, saying, "What [are] these, my lord?" Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord." So he answered and said to me: "This [is] the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: 'Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,' Says the LORD of hosts. 'Who [are] you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel [you shall become] a plain! And he shall bring forth the capstone With shouts of "Grace, grace to it!" ' " Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying: "The hands of Zerubbabel Have laid the foundation of this temple; His hands shall also finish [it]. Then you will know That the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. For who has despised the day of small things? For these seven rejoice to see The plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. They are the eyes of the LORD, Which scan to and fro throughout the whole earth." Then I answered and said to him, "What [are] these two olive trees--at the right of the lampstand and at its left?" And I further answered and said to him, "What [are these] two olive branches that [drip] into the receptacles of the two gold pipes from which the golden [oil] drains?" Then he answered me and said, "Do you not know what these [are]?" And I said, "No, my lord." So he said, "These [are] the two anointed ones, who stand beside the Lord of the whole earth."</p>
        Who are the two anointed ones that stand by the Father? The Holy Spirit and the Son - represented as two cherubim on the mercy seat of the Father. What happened in Jerusalem in 30 AD?
        <p class='bibleQuote'>{Rev 11:11-14 NKJV} Now after the three-and-a-half days the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them. And they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here." And they ascended to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies saw them. In the same hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. In the earthquake seven thousand people were killed, and the rest were afraid and gave glory to the God of heaven. The second woe is past. Behold, the third woe is coming quickly.</p>
        They were <i>resurrected</i> after three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered them. There was a great earthquake and a tenth of that city (Jerusalem) fell. This is the second woe, and NOTE - JOHN SAYS IT IS PAST!
        </p>
        <p class="bibleQuote">{Rev 1:1-3 NKJV} The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show His servants--things which must shortly take place. And He sent and signified [it] by His angel to His servant John, who bore witness to the word of God, and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, to all things that he saw. Blessed [is] he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time [is] near.</p>
        <p>I'm not going to dig too much into this, but God has revealed to me the true nature of the Trinity - the Son is under the Father, and we see that even here. God is the Father, Elohim - Jesus Christ is the Servant of the Father Elohim. However, as we also learn - Jesus is fully God incarnate. This doesn't mean we don't pray to Jesus - we can, and as you've seen and heard me do I easily interchange Jesus with Yeshu'ah. The Son has that name, but like my name it's pronounced slightly differently in every language - God knows who you are talking to. It's by our heart, not by our lips. The lips produce the confession of the heart.</p>
