        <p>Now that we've covered the background of the various views, let's go over what the Lord has revealed to me. As I've said - our revelation of scripture should be continual. We should always be growing in knowledge and wisdom.</p>
        <p>First is the basic structure of the book. The opening of the book, describes the author (John) and the revelator (Yeshu'ah). It tells us what day we are seeing, and this will come as a shock to most who believe verse 10 is about Sunday. When we approach any verse, we <i>must</i> approach it with at least two or three witnesses, to make sound doctrine. I also now suggest for serious students, in addition to prayer, fasting? look at other translations. Don't limit yourself to reading one translation. There are <B>MANY</B> excellent translations out there, that may help you grasp this better, if you are also willing and able to listen to the Holy Spirit. The opening compromises the first three chapters, with letters to the seven major assemblies of that day. I don't really believe these represent "ages", I do believe John was addressing seven literal churches of that era. Like much of the Bible there are layers, and the seven assemblies have characteristics throughout the world's various assemblies.</p>
        <p>The first vision starts with John in Heaven at Chapter 4, as He opens with telling us - this is on the Day of the Lord. (NOT SUNDAY) It's important to remember - space and time are foreign concepts in Heaven. This is crucial to understanding John's visions, the book of Revelation is NOT MEANT TO BE LITERAL, nor is it meant to be read like you read John's Gospel. This goes through chapters 4 and 5, and glorifies Yeshu'ah as the glorious lamb.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="bibleQuote">{Rev 1:1-3 NKJV} The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show His servants--things which must shortly take place. And He sent and signified [it] by His angel to His servant John, who bore witness to the word of God, and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, to all things that he saw. Blessed [is] he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time [is] near.</p>
        <p>I'm not going to dig too much into this, but God has revealed to me the true nature of the Trinity - the Son is under the Father, and we see that even here. God is the Father, Elohim - Jesus Christ is the Servant of the Father Elohim. However, as we also learn - Jesus is fully God incarnate. This doesn't mean we don't pray to Jesus - we can, and as you've seen and heard me do I easily interchange Jesus with Yeshu'ah. The Son has that name, but like my name it's pronounced slightly differently in every language - God knows who you are talking to. It's by our heart, not by our lips. The lips produce the confession of the heart.</p>
