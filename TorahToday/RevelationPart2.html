        <p>Now that we've covered the background of the various views, let's go over what the Lord has revealed to me. As I've said - our revelation of scripture should be continual. We should always be growing in knowledge and wisdom.</p>
        <p class="bibleQuote">{Rev 1:1-3 NKJV} The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show His servants--things which must shortly take place. And He sent and signified [it] by His angel to His servant John, who bore witness to the word of God, and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, to all things that he saw. Blessed [is] he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time [is] near.</p>
        <p>I'm not going to dig too much into this, but God has revealed to me the true nature of the Trinity - the Son is under the Father, and we see that even here. God is the Father, Elohim - Jesus Christ is the Servant of the Father Elohim. However, as we also learn - Jesus is fully God incarnate.</p>
