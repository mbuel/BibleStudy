        <h2>Who is the "man of sin"</h2>
        <p class="bibleQuote">2Th 2:3 TS2009 Let no one deceive you in any way, because the falling away is to come first, and the man of lawlessness is to be revealed, the son of destruction,</p>
        <p class="bibleQuote">Rev 13:18 TS2009 Here is the wisdom! He who has understanding, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty six.</p>
        <p class="normal">In both places by two different writers, they use the PLURAL for "man", anthropos.
        It's MANKIND, and specifically both 2 Thess 2 and Revelation are warning us of the same thing. Who are these people?</p>
        <ol>
            <li>they promote LAWLESSNESS. That the law is abolished? That Jesus obeyed for you? Jesus did it all?
                That's the gospel of another Jesus, a lawless GOSPEL.</li>
            <li>which leads me to the second point. These people confess faith in Yeshua. Paul is strongly referring to deut 13.</li>
        </ol>   
        <p class="bibleQuote">Deu 13:1-5 TS2009 1 “When there arises among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams, and he shall give you a sign or a wonder, 2 and the sign or the wonder shall come true, of which he has spoken to you, saying, ‘Let us go after other mighty ones – which you have not known – and serve them,’ 3 do not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams, for יהוה your Elohim is trying you to know whether you love יהוה your Elohim with all your heart and with all your being. 4 “Walk after יהוה your Elohim and fear Him, and guard His commands and obey His voice, and serve Him and cling to Him. 5 “And that prophet or that dreamer of dreams is put to death, because he has spoken apostasy against יהוה your Elohim – who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim and ransomed you from the house of bondage – to make you stray from the way in which יהוה your Elohim commanded you to walk. Thus you shall purge the evil from your midst.</p>
        
        <p class="normal"> These believers in the Messiah, will lure you away with signs and wonders. (Signs and wonders should follow believers, God intentionally allowed cessationism to take over the body, so that there would be an appeal in the last hour to restore those things. This is healthy, but we should not SEEK them, they should FIND us in humility.)
        How can we test those signs and wonders?</p>
        <p class="bibleQuote">Deu 13:2 TS2009 and the sign or the wonder shall come true, of which he has spoken to you, saying, ‘Let us go after other mighty ones – which you have not known – and serve them,’</p>
        <p class="normal">The key is in doctrine - test all things, hold fast to what is true.</p>
        <p class="bibleQuote">2Th 2:9-12 TS2009 9 The coming of the lawless one is according to the working of Satan, with all power and signs and wonders of falsehood, 10 and with all deceit of unrighteousness in those perishing, because they did not receive the love of the truth, in order for them to be saved. 11 And for this reason Elohim sends them a working of delusion, for them to believe the falsehood, 12 in order that all should be judged who did not believe the truth, but have delighted in the unrighteousness.</p>
        <p class="normal">You have to love the truth. Yeshu'ah, and His law are joined as the truth. If you love Yeshu'ah, you obey Him. You are law abiding, being yoked to God the Father through the Holy Spirit and His Son.</p>
        <p class="normal">This warning is paramount to get in your heart.</p>
        <p class="normal">Those preaching against the law, are under the delusion.</p>
        <p class="bibleQuote">Rev 13:11 TS2009 And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon.</p>
        <p class="normal">Those who look like lambs, but speak the language of the dragon. What's the language of the dragon?</p>
        <h3 class="normal">Let's review</h3>
        <h4 class="list">First lie:</h4>
        <p class="bibleQuote">Gen 3:4 TS2009 And the naḥash said to the woman, “You shall certainly not die.</p>
        <p class="normal">That our sin will not lead to our death. What is sin? All sin is LAWLESSNESS. Our lawlessness, will lead to our death. Your submission to Yeshu'ah as Savior doesn't change the wages of sin.</p>
        <h4 class="list">Second lie:</h4>
        <p class="bibleQuote">Gen 4:9 TS2009 And יהוה said to Qayin, “Where is Heḇel your brother?” And he said, “I do not know. Am I my brother’s guard?”</p>
        <p class="normal">That we are not responsible for our brethren. Christians should be extremely generous, helping even their enemies.</p>
        <p class="bibleQuote">Act 20:35 TS2009 “All this I did show you, by labouring like this, that you ought to help the weak. And remember the words of the Master יהושע, that He said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’ ”</p>
        <p class="normal">This is part of the good news, part of becoming a law abiding citizen in God's Kingdom is to care for the down trodden, to seek justice for the widow and the orphan.</p>
        <h2>We are, our brothers keeper</h2>
        <p class="bibleQuote">Gal 6:2 TS2009 Bear one another’s burdens, and so complete the Torah of Messiah.</p>
        <p class="normal">This points to all of Torah. Those filled with the love of Messiah, naturally obey all of God's law. The whole of the ten commandments, and the entirety of the rest of his law.</p>
        <h4 class="list">Third lie:</h4>
        <p class="bibleQuote">Gen 6:4-6 TS2009 4 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of Elohim came in to the daughters of men and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, the men of name. 5 And יהוה saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. 6 And יהוה was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart.</p>
        <p class="normal">That because sex feels good, it's good to have freely. This is the curse over women, and men subject themselves to it. Women *desire* over their man, but they should rule over it.</p>
        <p class="normal">This doesn't mean sex is a sin, IN MARRIAGE. But that is the proper constraint. God doesn't become blind to your antics, even if you're married. There is a proper use for your bodies, and that use is CREATION. Anal and oral sex?</p>
        <p class="normal">They are violence against God - it defiles the act of sex, even in marriage.</p>
        <p class="bibleQuote">Heb 13:4 TS2009 Let marriage be respected by all, and the bed be undefiled. But Elohim shall judge those who whore, and adulterers.</p>
        <p class="normal">Some translations make this appear as no act can defile the marriage bed. That's not what Paul is telling us.
        He's warning the marriage bed CAN BE DEFILED, and this comes after Paul warns us a out Esau;</p>
        <p class="bibleQuote">Heb 12:15-17 TS2009 15 See to it that no one falls short of the favour of Elohim, that no root of bitterness springing up causes trouble, by which many become defiled, 16 lest there be anyone who whores, or profane one, like Ěsaw, who for a single meal sold his birthright. 17 For you know that afterward, when he wished to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought it with tears.</p>
        <p class="normal">Esau lost the inheritance for food, but just as importantly?</p>
        <p class="normal">He was sexually immoral with loose women. Loose women, that Esau made his wife.</p>
        <p class="normal">Go through the Bible and look for Satan's lies. That the sabbath changed to Sunday, that it is okay for a Christian to eat swine's flesh.</p>
        <h3>How was the temple defiled?</h3>
        <p class="bibleQuote">Dan 11:31 RNKJV And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.</p>
        <h3>What is the abomination?</h3>
        <p class="bibleQuote">Lev 11:11 RNKJV They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.</p>
        <p class="normal">Swine, and other unclean animals.</p>
        <h3>This is repeated in other prophecy...</h3>
        <p class="bibleQuote">[Isa 65:4 HNV] "who sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places; who eat pig's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;"</p>
        <p class="normal">"Well how are we doing that in the third temple? We aren't standing in the temple with our profane sacrifice of swine's flesh?"</p>
        <p class="normal">The conclusion of the matter is this and simply this. Paul is the man of sin, and stood in the temple and defiled it. Yah willing I hope to put more studies up here revealing that.</p>
