        <p>The shutdown is <em>NOT</em> about our health - it is about <strong>CONTROL</strong> and their goal is nefarious.</p>
        <p>Before I get to what the Lord revealed to me however, I want to say this. God is in control of all things. He is the Alpha and the Omega. Nothing happens that He did not <strong>ALLOW</strong> to happen. This includes the enemy laying waste to you. Like with Job, this doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you are in sin. It could be a trial God is growing with you through that, to sharpen you.</p>
        <p>It&#39;s also possible, you&#39;ve sinned and have an open door and now need to go through deliverance. </p>
        <p>Either way, Job gives us the model. Prayer and fasting will help remove the stronghold!</p>
        <p>Likewise, our heart can develop a root of bitterness. This develops <em>MAINLY</em> from unforgiveness in our hearts toward others. I heard a teacher this morning say that our unforgiveness doesn&#39;t have to look like that of God. We can forgive without blotting out that person&#39;s sin. I don&#39;t personally see that biblically, but I don&#39;t expect others to agree with me on everything - that&#39;s the mentality of a cult.</p>
        <p>What the Lord showed me is that this shutdown is specifically designed to destroy the economy, and weaken the citizens of the globe. Numerous studies have backed this up - when we are shut in all the time? Our immune system gets weaker. When we are shut in all the time? People become more depressed - and you see this in the hearts of men and women right now. Calls to suicide hotlines have dramatically increased. (God is seeking them to repent)</p>
        <p>When people are shut in all the time? They turn from doing what is right to sin. They forget how to behave around other people. </p>
        <p>This is intentional to weaken us, and to turn us from being self-sufficient to <strong>REQUIRING</strong> assistance from our state to eat, to sleep and to shelter. </p>
        <p>They <strong>WANT SLAVES</strong> but God as I said, is <strong>ALLOWING</strong> this to turn our hearts back to Him. Unlike the Israelites in Egypt, we don&#39;t have 415 years to wait for the day of the Lord - the day of Salvation. We have less than a decade by my belief. I haven&#39;t been told the exact time - but I know from what the Lord has shown me that the final time of trials <em>HAS</em> begun. </p>
        <p>Don&#39;t let them weaken you - stay strong in the Lord, and even in your house strive to move more than your idle. This is why a day of rest (Sabbath) is still crucial as well. It helps set the cadence for the week, it&#39;s something I look forward to, even while working from home.</p>
