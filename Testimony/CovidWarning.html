        <p>While every false Prophet was promising greater wealth and riches for believers this year the Lord kept telling me, <em>PREPARE</em>. I knew as soon as last October that the shaking would start in March. I repented to the Lord for not sharing it more broadly. I should have obeyed Him - but I have had to grow in my faith over the past year. I&#39;m done doubting the Lord.</p>
        <p>After the CoronaVirus there is going to be a global famine. The signs of that are already appearing in the News, if you are keen, you&#39;ve caught on. Global production and supply chains have been crippled, shut down - and they aren&#39;t just going to restart over night. What this means is one of two things, food prices that are - for lack of a better word, <em>insane</em> - or store shelves that are even worse than they have been during the Corona Virus, plague of fear - empty.</p>
        <p>What happens after that and in what order is still fuzzy. There will be another plague, and I&#39;m not the only one prophesying of that - it&#39;s going to be worse than the first, not just fear but far more contagious and far more deadly. This one will lead to a global police state. It will lead to the New World Order finally getting what they desire, the public shut down of Christianity. If you&#39;re Church hasn&#39;t done so yet, it needs to go underground. I mean <strong>UNDERGROUND</strong> as well with that statement. No cell phones, no computers, no streaming. It&#39;s going to be like China - where Zoom worship sessions lead to the arrest of those participating.</p>
        <p>The Lord showed me that during a dream, right before the forced global quarantine of so many nations - it was an even tighter quarantine, and the military was enforcing it. I visited someone&#39;s house and talked about the Lord - the result was they knew I was there, from the listening devices we have in every home. (Alexa, Siri, Google, etc)</p>
        <p>This leads me to my study - a study that needs to happen. A proper perspective of Revelation, because so many are expecting a seven year countdown to His return, and I&#39;m here to warn you, it&#39;s going to be <em>MUCH</em> faster. Those of you waiting to be raptured out? That timeline is done, we are in the last hour - we are in the countdown to the day of the Lord.</p>
