    <h1 id="pageTitle">The future is uncertain, are you certain?</h1>
    <div id="pageBody">
       <p>The question every believer needs to ask amid these uncertain times is this. Are you sure that <i>you</i> <b>KNOW</b> Yeshu'ah as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords? Is He your <i>PERSONAL</i> Savior?</p>
       <p class="bibleQuote">{Psa 23:1-4 HNV} A Psalm by David. The LORD is <b class="">MY</b> shepherd: I shall lack nothing. He makes <b class="">ME</b> lie down in green pastures. He leads <b class="">ME</b> beside still waters. He restores <b class="">MY</b> soul. He guides <b class="">ME</b> in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Even though <b class="">I</b> walk through the valley of the shadow of death, <b class="">I</b> will fear no evil, for you are with <b class="">ME</b>. Your rod and your staff, they comfort <b class="">ME</b>.</p>
        <p class="normal"><b class="">YOU MUST</b> have a personal relationship with the Messiah, the Lord of all. He must become YOUR Savior, YOUR friend, YOUR first love. In the dream my wife had last night, she saw the coming authoritarian state - and yes you will be here. The second seal was opened this week. They were using military vehicles to scan the interior of houses, and before it scanned our house, she prayed over the house - the Psalm of protection, with a heart of faith that Yeshu'ah is her Lord, Savior and God.</p>
        <p class="bibleQuote">{Psa 91:1-16 HNV} He who dwells in the secret place of Ha`Elyon Will rest in the shadow of Shaddai. I will say of the LORD, "He is my refuge and my fortress; My God, in whom I trust." For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler, And from the deadly pestilence. He will cover you with his feathers. Under his wings you will take refuge. His faithfulness is your shield and rampart. You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, Nor of the arrow that flies by day; Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, Nor of the destruction that wastes at noonday. A thousand may fall at your side, And ten thousand at your right hand; But it will not come near you. You will only look with your eyes, And see the recompense of the wicked. Because you have made LORD your refuge, And Ha`Elyon your dwelling place, No evil shall happen to you, Neither shall any plague come near your dwelling. For he will give his angels charge over you, To guard you in all your ways. They will bear you up in their hands, So that you won't dash your foot against a stone. You will tread on the lion and cobra. You will trample the young lion and the serpent underfoot. "Because he has set his love on me, therefore I will deliver him. I will set him on high, because he has known my name. He will call on me, and I will answer him. I will be with him in trouble. I will deliver him, and honor him. I will satisfy him with long life, And show him my yeshu`ah." </p>
        <p class="normal">When she prayed this Psalm over the house, the fowler - the wicked one could not see inside the house. This is the power that will come down on the true saints of Yah striving to keep His commandments. (Rev 12:17) They will go on to do greater things, than our Messiah did while here. Fear the Lord and do what is right. (Acts 10:34,35) When our family witnessed this miracle, they all fell on their face in fear. People wanted to get inside the house, <i class="">and COULD NOT.</i> You have to have <b>REAL AND GENUINE repentance!</b> FORSAKE YOUR LAWLESS BEHAVIOR!</p>
        {Rom 6:19 NKJV} I speak in human [terms] because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members [as] slaves of uncleanness, and of lawlessness [leading] to [more] lawlessness, so now present your members [as] slaves [of] righteousness for holiness.
        <p class="">BEFORE being saved <i>from</i> sin we were slaves of lawlessness (all sin is lawlessness) - which just leads to more and more lawlessness. This is what we will see in the last days, and in the body of Messiah. They will reject the law of God, elevating Paul as their god. Make no mistake, Paul was a man of Yah - but he is ONE WITNESS of the Messiah. just because he has 14 epistles telling you the same basic ideas in different ways, doesn't make those 14 epistles <i>different witnesses.</i> Focus on the <b class="">ENTIRETY</b> of God's word, just as Paul tells you to do. Don't be a lawless man (2 Thess 2) making profane sacrifices in the temple (1 Co 3:16-17).</p>
        <h3>GOD WILL DESTROY YOU.</h3>
