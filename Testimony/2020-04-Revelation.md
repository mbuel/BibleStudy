The shutdown is *NOT* about our health - it is about **CONTROL** and their goal is nefarious.

Before I get to what the Lord revealed to me however, I want to say this. God is in control of all things. He is the Alpha and the Omega. Nothing happens that He did not **ALLOW** to happen. This includes the enemy laying waste to you. Like with Job, this doesn't necessarily mean you are in sin. It could be a trial God is growing with you through that, to sharpen you.

It's also possible, you've sinned and have an open door and now need to go through deliverance. 

Either way, Job gives us the model. Prayer and fasting will help remove the stronghold!

Likewise, our heart can develop a root of bitterness. This develops *MAINLY* from unforgiveness in our hearts toward others. I heard a teacher this morning say that our unforgiveness doesn't have to look like that of God. We can forgive without blotting out that person's sin. I don't personally see that biblically, but I don't expect others to agree with me on everything - that's the mentality of a cult.

What the Lord showed me is that this shutdown is specifically designed to destroy the economy, and weaken the citizens of the globe. Numerous studies have backed this up - when we are shut in all the time? Our immune system gets weaker. When we are shut in all the time? People become more depressed - and you see this in the hearts of men and women right now. Calls to suicide hotlines have dramatically increased. (God is seeking them to repent)

When people are shut in all the time? They turn from doing what is right to sin. They forget how to behave around other people. 

This is intentional to weaken us, and to turn us from being self-sufficient to **REQUIRING** assistance from our state to eat, to sleep and to shelter. 

They **WANT SLAVES** but God as I said, is **ALLOWING** this to turn our hearts back to Him. Unlike the Israelites in Egypt, we don't have 415 years to wait for the day of the Lord - the day of Salvation. We have less than a decade by my belief. I haven't been told the exact time - but I know from what the Lord has shown me that the final time of trials *HAS* begun. 

Don't let them weaken you - stay strong in the Lord, and even in your house strive to move more than your idle. This is why a day of rest (Sabbath) is still crucial as well. It helps set the cadence for the week, it's something I look forward to, even while working from home.
