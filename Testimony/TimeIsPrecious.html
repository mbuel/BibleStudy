    <h1 id="pageTitle">Time is precious</h1>
    <div id="pageBody">
        <p>I was recently watching a sermon from a messianic congregation I've really learned a lot from - I'm not interested in calling them out here, as I've not contacted them personally to discuss this with them first. What I am going to warn about - is the danger of where we spend our time.</p>
        <p>My journey and walk in Christ I spent most of my time lukewarm, just doing what is right in my own eyes. For many years, I was in bondage to pornography. It was my master, but the primary master was actually <i>entertainment</i> through movies and video games. I loved the Avengers series, loved football, and loved my game systems. I spent <b>tens of thousands</b> of dollars on these things over the decades I was acting out of the lust of the flesh, the lust of my eyes, and the pride of life. God's ways were the last thing I was concerned about - even though He radically saved me from a demon on my chest in sleep paralysis.</p>
        <h3>A believer can lose salvation!</h3>
        <p>I spent most of those years, not even feeling guilty about my sin even though I prayed to God when problems came. It was when I started re-reading the Bible - starting at the Beginning, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua then Judges - it was reading through the Bible (I praise the Lord it was outside of the Babylon system) that the Holy Spirit's conviction came back to my heart. It was this conviction from the Spirit that led me to turn my whole life back to serving King Yeshu'ah. The first thing I decided to do was to start attending a local church, I knew even as a reborn baby Christian seeking relationship with Messiah again, that I needed also relationship with His people.</p>
        <h3>The Mega Church</h3>
        <p>I chose the first church based on watching several online sermons, and he was strongly speaking for absolute morality, and the word of God being His standard. I did grow here, but soon realized that no one else was growing. This all seemed okay at first, and I was <i>heavily</i> involved in activities at the Church, trying to find my fulfillment in God. Trying to help others build themselves up, and striving to turn them from sin to righteousness. At the same time I was dealing with my Spiritual growth and the lukewarm teachings here, the Holy Spirit was dealing with me and trying to get me to stop lusting after pornography. At the beginning of my time at that church, I like most of the people attending believed in Eternal Security - even though the Church itself was Assembly of God and professes faith AGAINST once saved always saved. The Lord kept pressing on me, because I was drawing near to Him. He kept telling me, I <b>had to stop sinning</b> which I didn't understand at the time, because eternal security is <i>so widely taught</i>. This is the Gospel most non-Christians are exposed to - and at this time in my walk, the Lord had not revealed to my heart that HE HAD stepped away from me for several decades. I forgot about the sleep paralysis experience, until I experienced more freedom. I decided to start attending a support group for pornography at the Church - it's called <i>conquerors</i> and I <i>will</i> call them out as it is <b>occult.</b> If you truly want motivation to stop serving sin, know the truth. You <i>cannot</i> enter the Kingdom of God in that sin. 
            <p class="bibleQuote">{1Co 6:9-10 HNV} Or don't you know that the unrighteous will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Don't be deceived. Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor extortioners, will inherit the Kingdom of God.</p>
