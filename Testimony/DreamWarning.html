        <p>We were staying in a little Air BnB outside of Grant&#39;s Pass, OR headed back up to my home in Renton, WA. Wife woke up startled, she had a dream that it was dark, we were on the Freeway and she saw us rounding a gentle curve. There was a giant semi in front and behind us, and suddenly without warning a speeding semi rapidly approaching and merging <strong>INTO our lane.</strong> She told me we died in the accident, crushed by the truck.</p>
        <p>On the way home from Oregon, in through Olympia and I was intentionally driving cautiously. She recognized the spot, but as we were heading up the hill, and I saw the truck behind me, in front of me, and one in the side mirror <em>SPEEDING UP</em> the Holy Spirit immediately urged me to <em>GET OVER NOW</em> because that driver didn&#39;t see me. </p>
        <p>As soon as I got over, the Semi-Truck driver merged into the lane where our car was at. </p>
        <p>Glory to the Lord for His hand of protection, His mercies are new every day.</p>
