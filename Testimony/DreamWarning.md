# After getting married - 2019

We were staying in a little Air BnB outside of Grant's Pass, OR headed back up to my home in Renton, WA. Wife woke up startled, she had a dream that it was dark, we were on the Freeway and she saw us rounding a gentle curve. There was a giant semi in front and behind us, and suddenly without warning a speeding semi rapidly approaching and merging **INTO our lane.** She told me we died in the accident, crushed by the truck.

On the way home from Oregon, in through Olympia and I was intentionally driving cautiously. She recognized the spot, but as we were heading up the hill, and I saw the truck behind me, in front of me, and one in the side mirror *SPEEDING UP* the Holy Spirit immediately urged me to *GET OVER NOW* because that driver didn't see me. 

As soon as I got over, the Semi-Truck driver merged into the lane where our car was at. 

Glory to the Lord for His hand of protection, His mercies are new every day.
