        I am a web developer with a passion for learning and a zeal for Torah. Yehovah gave me this zeal to remember, to learn and to teach truth. My goal however is not to be your teacher, but to make Yah your one and only source of truth, through His Torah. Christians today, cannot even stand hearing the word "law" (Torah) because of the antichrist that was canonized by the Catholic Church. Ask yourself one question.
        <p>If Paul was removed from the Bible - what would you believe?</p>
        <p>One could remove one of any other book from the Bible and it would not affect what we fundamentally believe as Yah repeats himself to us. Paul's message is <em>ONLY</em> taught by Paul and by no one else. His saving message isn't even what he taught in Acts. </p>
